Live link: [https://abstractly.vercel.app/](https://abstractly.vercel.app/)

A full-stack mock marketing website and UI component library composed of
[GreatFrontEnd project challenges](https://www.greatfrontend.com/projects).

I created it as a personal project to demonstrate proficiency with its key
technologies: React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Express, and
PostgreSQL.

This project is mirrored on Github at: https://github.com/av0ed/abstractly
